# Pong DQN Reinforcement Learning Project 🎮🤖

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that learns to play the Pong game using Reinforcement Learning.

## Features
- Custom Pong environment using Pygame
- Deep Q-Network using PyTorch
- Experience replay
- Epsilon-greedy strategy
- Trained agent can play automatically

## Files
- `game_env.py` – Pong game environment
- `dqn_agent.py` – DQN agent and neural network
- `train.py` – Train the agent
- `play.py` – Watch the trained agent play

## How to Run

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
